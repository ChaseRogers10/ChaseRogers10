## Hi there!

I'm Chase, a senior at the University of Oregon majoring in advertising and minoring in digital humanities.

Currently, I'm working on:
- Advertising production for various client's through UO's **Allen Hall Advertising**.
- A personal photography project/series documenting and following the unique people and personalities around Oregon. The project has a tentative title of ***"We Know Where Our Feet Should Be Planted"***.
- Getting to NYC following graduation.
